10. Holacracy
Lately Iâ€™ve been interested in the concept of holacracy and how teams stay fluid and adjust to the changing demands of a market.
This article at Blinkist explains the concept of Accountabilities, Roles, and People. In summary:
The actions that need to be taken care of are called Accountabilities.
Accountabilities are clustered into Roles.
Roles are assigned to People who have the skills and resources to fill them.
People can hold multiple roles, even ones that seem unrelated
Roles are flexible. Accountabilities can change.
New Roles can emerge out of changing Accountabilities.
