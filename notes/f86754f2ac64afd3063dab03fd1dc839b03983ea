As per discussion offline, we could adopt the convention of storing all
collections in a yaml document.

They are accessible via

```
yq r inventory.yml inventory.plans
```

Where `plans` is a substitue for an association ala holocracy org

This project can then provide associations in the form of jekyll config to
facilitate publishing to the web
